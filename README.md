# subs
Light desktop application for downloading subtitles from OpenSubtitles, by simply dragging and dropping video files on a GUI.

## Disclaimer
I made this software a few months ago, and it has served me and my friends extremely well since then, in both French and English.
However, there should be some problems and some bad hacks in the code. I don't mind them, and thus won't be fixing them anytime soon. If they bother you, however, you're welcome to fork this repo, or open a pull request.
